# What is GIT

Git is an open source Distributed Version Control System (DVCS). O

## Distributed vs Centralized

**Centralized**. One repo and lots of clients.

**Distributed**. One repo with lots of client repos, each with a user.

## Snapshots vs Deltas

In some VCS like SVN, it is the delta/changes in files that are recorded over time. When recording a delta - it is only the changes in each file that gets recorded.

With Git, a snapshot is taken - a full version of the files in the staging area is saved when a commit is done.

## Lightweight Branches

## Easily Curated Commits

Since Git stores full versions of the files with each commit, and everything is stored locally - it's easier to curate commits.

# Git configuration

## `git config --global user`

`.name <name>`: Setup your name.
`.email <email>`: Setup your email.

Set the name and email that will be attached to your commits.

## `git config --global alias`

Set short forms for frequently used commands.

Examples:

```
git config --global alias.st status
git config --global alias.ci commit
git config --global alias.br branch
git config --global alias.co checkout
git config --global alias.df diff
git config --global alias.lg 'log -p'
git config --global alias.lg1 'log --graph --abbrev-commit --decorate --date=relative --format=format:\'%C(bold blue)%h%C(reset) - %C(bold green)(%ar)%C(reset) %C(white)%s%C(reset) %C(dim white)- %an%C(reset)%C(bold yellow)%d%C(reset)\' --all'
```

# The three states of Git

![inline](http://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/basic-usage.svg.png)

Git has three states, and understanding how git interacts with these states can help make it easier to reason about working with it. The three states in Git are:

### History

History is located in the .git directory, and is where the metadata and
object database of your project is stored. This is what's copied when
you clone a repository

### Working Directory

A version of the project that is checked out and placed on disk.

Its files are pulled out of the compressed database in the .git
directory.

### Staging

A file, in the .git directory, that stores information about what will
go into your next commit.
