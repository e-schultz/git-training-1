# Understanding the GIT Model

## The three states of Git

![inline](http://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/basic-usage.svg.png)

Git has three states, and understanding how git interacts with these states can help make it easier to reason about working with it. The three states in Git are:

### History

History is located in the .git directory, and is where the metadata and
object database of your project is stored. This is what's copied when
you clone a repository

### Working Directory

A version of the project that is checked out and placed on disk.

Its files are pulled out of the compressed database in the .git
directory.

### Staging

A file, in the .git directory, that stores information about what will
go into your next commit.
